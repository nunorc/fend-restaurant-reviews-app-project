# Restaurant Reviews App Project

Prepared in the context of Udacity's Front End Developer nanodegree.

## Run the application locally

To run the application locally download or [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the project repository. In the folder repository, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, in a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server using:

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

(or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use:

    $ python3 -m http.server 8000

If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
